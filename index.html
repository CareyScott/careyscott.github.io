          <p>
            I am a 23-year-old Software Engineer/ Developer from Dublin, Ireland
            currently living between Hanover, Germany and Dublin. I am seeking
            employment to relocate to Germany to live full time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was awarded First Class Honours (1:1) in BSc(Hons) in Creative
            Computing at the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design, and
            Technology in Dublin. Also recieved verbal commendation from course
            tutor on the quality of my Capstone Project and Thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a huge passion for programming but also music! I often busk
            on Grafton Street in Dublin in my spare time, which I have done for
            nearly six years now! From this, I have gained tremendous
            self-confidence, a bubbly personality and excellent communication
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a particular interest in Backend & Full Stack Development. I
            taught myself to create a Computer Vision model utilising Microsoft
            Azures Cognitive services. I made a scalable and efficient algorithm
            hosted on a REST API server. This API runs the recognition function
            and generates code from an image of a hand-drawn wireframe sketch
            uploaded and stored in Azure Storage Containers. The generated code
            is viewable to the end-user on the React.js front. This application
            includes the creations of multiple database solutions and models in
            order for the data to be stored.

          <p>
            I have a keen interest in innovation and always strive to bring
            imagination to reality. Over the past few years i have been actively
            seeking new projects to create and work on.
          </p>

          <h3>Solar Returns (2022 - Present)</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently collaborating with a Engineering Masters student from
            UCD to create a solar calculations app named Solar Returns. This app
            accepts parameters from the end user to determine the monitary
            payback from installing solar pannels to a home after a period of 25
            years.
          </p>

          <h3>Prontotyper (2022)</h3>

          <p>
            Recently, I developed an Object Detection model which recognises and
            predicts hand drawn images of web elements in conjunction with a
            React.js frontend and REST API to serve the prediction model and
            generate appropriate code for the user to be able to use in real
            time. The algorithm then generates appropriate HTML code for the
            user to use and edit in real time. The tool uses two Azure storage
            solutions (Blobs & Cosmos DB with mongoose schema) in addition to
            Azure cognitive services.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Self-Made (2021 - 2022)</h3>
          <p>
            I worked and cooperated alongside a class colleague to design and
            develop a webbased application within the Homestead environment
            using Laravel PHP Framework. The application was intended for use by
            job seekers and employers within the start-up sector. The
            application also included a Andriod companion app which was coded
            with Kotlin to allow users to view job listings on the move.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have many other projects which are still in the initial
            phases of development.
