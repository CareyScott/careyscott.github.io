          </p>
          <p>
            I am proud to have achieved First Class Honours (1:1) in my
            BSc(Hons) in Creative Computing degree from Dun Laoghaire Institute
            of Art, Design, and Technology in Dublin. Additionally, I received
            glowing verbal commendation from my course tutor for the exceptional
            quality of my Capstone Project and Thesis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Programming is a massive passion of mine. I'm always eager to learn
            new programming concepts and feel deeply fulfilled when my code
            successfully solves a problem. I am all about solving real-world
            problems with technology. I strive to learn and grow. I thrive in
            fast-paced environments and am always eager to take on new
            challenges. I'm always fully immersed in the task, and my passion
            for programming shines through in my work. I'm confident that I have
            the experience, skills, and passion for programming to thrive as a
            member of your team.

            I have a particular interest in Backend & Full Stack Development. I
            taught myself to create a Computer Vision model utilising Microsoft
            Azures Cognitive services. I made a scalable and efficient algorithm
            hosted on a REST API server. This API runs a recognition function
            that generates code from an image of a hand-drawn wireframe uploaded
            and stored in Azure Storage Containers. The generated code is
            viewable to the end-user on the React.js front. This application
            includes the creations of multiple database solutions and models in
            order for the data to be stored.

            seeking new projects to create and work on.

          <h3>Solar Returns (2022 - Present)</h3>
          <p>
            Currently, I am proudly partnering with a Engineering Masters
            student hailing from UCD to tackle the development of an innovative
            and groundbreaking solar calculations application: Solar Returns.
            This app boasts of its ability to accurately determine the
            significant monetary returns to be accrued by homeowners who opt to
            install solar panels in their homes - over a considerable period of
            25 years.
          </p>

          <h3>Prontotyper (2022)</h3>

          <p>
            Recently, I undertook a project where I developed an Object
            Detection model. The purpose of this model was to recognise and
            predict hand drawn images of web elements. To accomplish this, I
            made use of a React.js frontend and REST API. This enabled me to
            serve the prediction model and generate the necessary code for the
            user to employ in real time. As the user interfaced with the model,
            it generated appropriate HTML code which the user could edit and use
            or implement in real time. In order to enhance the model's
            effectiveness, I used two Azure storage solutions. This involved
            making use of both Blobs and Cosmos DB with mongoose schema. Lastly,
            to refine the model's ability to accurately predict and recognise
            web elements, I made use of Azure cognitive services. By doing so, I
            was able to ensure that the model was highly accurate in its
            predictions and easy to use for the end user.

          <h3>Self-Made (2021 - 2022)</h3>
          <p>
            I worked and cooperated alongside a class colleague to design and
            develop a webbased application within the Homestead environment
            using Laravel PHP Framework. The application was intended for use by
            job seekers and employers within the start-up sector. The
            application also included a Andriod companion app which was coded
            with Kotlin to allow users to view job listings on the move.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also have many other projects which are still in the initial
            phases of development.
